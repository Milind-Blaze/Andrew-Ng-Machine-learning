Dear Milind Kumar V,

thank you very much for your mail. Yes, your request arrived early enough and the date fits to my schedule next January.

I can come to India and speak during your lecture series. Do I understand correctly, that the exact date would be at some time between Jan. 4th. and Jan. 7th.?

Best regards,

Karlheinz Brandenburg
